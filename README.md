# bh1750-upython

This project is basically the replica of `https://github.com/PinkInk/upylib/tree/master/bh1750`. 
What I did is

1. copy <a href=https://github.com/PinkInk>PinkInk</a>'s bh1750
2. create a bh1750-upython-mip.json

So anyone who would like to install PinInk's bh1750 library to micoropython environment using `mip` tool, he/she can do it by
```python
import mip
mip.install('github:yhur/bh1750-upython/bh1750-upython-mip.json')
```
